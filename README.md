# APITestDataGen
API DataGen is an open-source tool designed to automatically generate test data for APIs defined using OpenAPI specifications. It aims to simplify the process of testing APIs by providing a seamless way to create realistic and diverse datasets based on the API schema.

Key Features:

OpenAPI Specification Parsing: The tool can parse OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications to understand the structure of the API, including endpoints, request methods, and data models.

Dynamic Test Data Generation: Based on the data models defined in the OpenAPI spec, API DataGen generates test data dynamically. It supports various data types (strings, numbers, booleans, dates, etc.) and can handle complex nested structures.
